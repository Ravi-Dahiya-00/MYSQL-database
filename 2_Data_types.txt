In MySQL, data types define the kind of values that can be stored in a table's columns. Choosing the appropriate data type ensures efficient storage and accurate data retrieval. MySQL offers several categories of data types:




Numeric Data Types
These types are used for numerical values.



Integer Types:
TINYINT: A very small integer. Signed range: -128 to 127. Unsigned range: 0 to 255.
SMALLINT: A small integer. Signed range: -32,768 to 32,767. Unsigned range: 0 to 65,535.
MEDIUMINT: A medium-sized integer. Signed range: -8,388,608 to 8,388,607. Unsigned range: 0 to 16,777,215.
INT or INTEGER: A standard integer. Signed range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Unsigned range: 0 to 4,294,967,295.
BIGINT: A large integer. Signed range: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. Unsigned range: 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.



Floating-Point Types:
FLOAT: A small (single-precision) floating-point number.    (upto 7 digits,take 4 byte of memory)
DOUBLE: A normal-size (double-precision) floating-point number.           (upto 15 digits,take 8 byte of memory)
 


Fixed-Point Types:
DECIMAL: An exact fixed-point number.   DECIMAL(5,2)                           5--> total_digit        2--> digits after decimal 
Note: The UNSIGNED attribute can be applied to numeric types to disallow negative values.








String Data Types
These types are used for text and binary data.



Character Types:
CHAR: A fixed-length string.
VARCHAR: A variable-length string.



Text Types:
TINYTEXT: A small text column.
TEXT: A standard text column.
MEDIUMTEXT: A medium-length text column.
LONGTEXT: A long text column.



Binary Types:
BINARY: Similar to CHAR, but stores binary byte strings.
VARBINARY: Similar to VARCHAR, but stores binary byte strings.



Blob Types:
TINYBLOB: A small binary large object.
BLOB: A standard binary large object.
MEDIUMBLOB: A medium-sized binary large object.
LONGBLOB: A large binary large object.



Enumeration Types:
ENUM: A string object with a value chosen from a list of permitted values.
SET: A string object that can have zero or more values, each chosen from a list of permitted values.









Date and Time Data Types
These types are used for temporal data.

DATE: A date value in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.
TIME: A time value in 'HH:MM:SS' format.
DATETIME: A combination of date and time in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' format.
TIMESTAMP: A timestamp value in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' format, typically used for tracking changes to records.
YEAR: A year value in four-digit format.
JSON Data Type
JSON: Stores JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data, allowing for efficient access and manipulation of JSON documents.







Spatial Data Types
These types are used for geometric data.

GEOMETRY: A spatial value of any type.
POINT: A point in 2D space.
LINESTRING: A sequence of points forming a continuous line.
POLYGON: A planar surface defined by one exterior boundary and zero or more interior boundaries.
